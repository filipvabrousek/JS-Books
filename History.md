##History of JavaScript
JavaScript, not to be confused with Java, was created in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, then working at Netscape and now of Mozilla.
 the original name was Mocha, September of 1995 the name was changed to LiveScript, 
 then in December, upon receiving a trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted. 
 This was somewhat of a marketing move at the time, with Java being very popular around then.
 In 1996 - 1997 JavaScript was taken to ECMA
